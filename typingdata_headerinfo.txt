Explanation of headers in typingdata.txt

"Subject" : subject number
"ParagraphType" : N = Normal paragraph; R = Random strings, B = Bigram strings
"IKSIs" : Interkeystroke interval in milliseconds for current keystroke
"Letters" : the letter that was typed
"PredBigram" : the preceding bigram contain the preceding letter and current letter
"SuccBigram" : the succeeding bigram containing the current letter and the next typed letter
"PredBigramCorrect" : 0=incorrect 1=correct for each letter in the preceding bigram
"SuccBigramCorrect" : 0=incorrect 1= correct for each letter in the succeeding bigram
"PredTrigram" : the preceding trigram, letters: n-2, n-1, n
"SuccTrigram" : the succeeding trigram, letters: n, n+1, n+2
"PredTrigramCorrect" : accuracy labels for each letter
"SuccTrigramCorrect" : accuracy labels for each letter
"GUT" : raw letter frequency estimated from sample of Gutenberg corpus
"PredBigramMLE" : expected likelihood of current letter n given letter n-1 (from gutenberg corpus)
"SuccBigramMLE" : expected likelihood of current letter n given letter n+1 (from gutenberg corpus)
"PredBigramFreq" : raw preceding bigram counts from gutenberg corpus
"SuccBigramFreq" : raw succeeding bigram counts from gutenberg corpus
"PredTrigramMLE" : expected likelihood of current letter given letters n-2 and n-1
"PredTrigramFreq" : raw preceding trigram counts from gutenberg corpus
"SuccTrigramMLE" : expected likelihood of current letter given letters n+1 and n+2
"SuccTrigramFreq" : raw succeeding trigram counts from gutenberg corpus
"let_pos" : position of the letter in the word
"word_lengths" : word length of current word
"probs" : the probability of current letter n given serial position and word length. Taken from Norvig's analysis of the google n-gram counts.
"whole_word" : the current word
"word_prob" : expected likelihood of word, from google n-gram corpus
